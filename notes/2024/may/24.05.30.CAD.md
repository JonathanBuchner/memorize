### Reverse sorting an array in C#

```csharp
public static void Sort (Array array, System.Collections.IComparer? comparer);
```

```csharp
var arr = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
Array.Sort(arr, (a, b) => b.CompareTo(a));
```
>Array.Sort(array, (x, y) => y.CompareTo(x));: 
This line sorts the array using a custom comparison function. The comparison function (x, y) => y.CompareTo(x) sorts the elements in descending order.

#### Lambda Expressions in C#
> Lambda expressions are used to create anonymous functions that can contain expressions and statements. They are particularly useful for writing inline, concise code that can be passed as delegates or used in LINQ queries.
>
> The syntax (x, y) => y.CompareTo(x) is called a lambda expression in C#.
> - (x, y): This part defines the parameters for the lambda expression. In this case, it takes two parameters, x and y.
> - =>: This is the lambda operator, which separates the parameters from the body of the lambda expression.
> - y.CompareTo(x): This is the body of the lambda expression, which defines what the function does. In this example, it calls the CompareTo method on y, comparing it to x, which effectively sorts the array in descending order when used with Array.Sort.

#### Difference between Expression and Statements

> In programming, statements and expressions are fundamental concepts that have distinct roles and purposes.
> 
> Expressions
> 
> An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and values that produce a value. Expressions are used to compute or retrieve data and always evaluate to a value.
> 
> Examples of expressions:
> - 5 + 3 (evaluates to 8)
> - x * y (evaluates to the product of x and y)
> - userName == "Alice" (evaluates to true or false)
> 
> Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or value, or they can be complex combinations of multiple operators and function calls.
> 
> Statements
> 
> A statement is a complete unit of execution in a program. Statements perform actions such as declaring variables, making decisions, or looping. Statements do not necessarily produce a value, and they often involve one or more expressions.

> Examples of statements:
> - Variable declaration: int x = 5;
> - Assignment: y = x + 2;
> - Control flow: if (x > y) { Console.WriteLine("x is greater"); }
> - Loop: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(i); }
> 
> Statements can be composed of expressions, but they serve a broader purpose by defining the flow and structure of the program.
>
> Key Differences
> 
> Purpose:
> - Expressions: Evaluate to a value.
> - Statements: Perform actions.
> 
> Evaluation:
> - Expressions: Always produce a value.
> - Statements: Do not necessarily produce a value.
> 
> Usage:
> - Expressions: Can be used within statements.
> - Statements: Define the control flow and actions of a program.

## LeetCode Problems

### 274. H-Index

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

```csharp

public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        Array.Sort(citations, (a, b) => b.CompareTo(a));
        var i = 0;

        while (i < citations.Length) {
            if (citations[i] < i + 1) {
                break;
            }

            i++;
        }

        return i;
    }
}

```

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        var max = citations.Length;
        var arr = new int[citations.Length + 1];

        for (var i = 0; i < citations.Length; i++) {
            var cits = Math.Min(max, citations[i]);
            arr[cits]++;
        }

        var count = 0;
        var j = arr.Length - 1;
        for (; j >= 0; j--) {
            count += arr[j];
            
            if (count >= j) {
                break;
            }
        }

        return j;
    }
}
```

### 1442. Count Triplets That Can Form Two Arrays of Equal XOR

**There is a solution with faster time complexity.**

```csharp

public class Solution {
    public int CountTriplets(int[] arr) {
        var result = 0;

        for (var i = 0; i < arr.Length - 1; i++) {
            for (var j = i + 1; j < arr.Length; j++) {
                for (var k = j; k < arr.Length; k++) {
                    var a = 0;
                    var b = 0;
                    var ii = i;
                    var jj = j;

                    while(ii < jj) {
                        a ^= arr[ii];
                        ii++;
                    }

                    while (jj <= k) {
                        b ^= arr[jj];
                        jj++;
                    }

                    if (a == b) {
                        result++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
